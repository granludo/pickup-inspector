Pickup-inspector aims to provide a software + hardware solution to analyze the qualities of electric guitar and electric bass pickups and wiring components.

While electric components are essential to tone, there's a lot of marketing induced mysticism on the properties of pickups resulting in outrageous differences in pricing. We, as musicians and engineers want to attempt a systematic approach to analyzing hardware for electric guitars and bases, get lots of DATA, publish it online and hope it helps us and fellow musicians to get better tone for our bucks.

Rock and roll!
